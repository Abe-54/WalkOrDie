## Walk Or Die
This is a short platformer, where the player is a bomb and they have to balance between moving and remaining still. The game was built within the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine for the 2022 Global Game Jam.

## Motivation
I decided to form a small team to see what I can create when I work with others in under 48 hours
